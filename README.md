# How to Install Mediapipe in Jetson Nano 2GB, 4GB, Jetson Xavier NX


Here, I Will show how to install MediaPipe in jetson nano and run an example program to make sure that it is working

The normal way to install mediapipe in Linux is not working 

So I have found a way to install mediapipe from source code, This way of installing is a little bit hard but it works very well in the jetsons.

So let us start this Tutorial 

In this tutorial, I am using a newly flashed jetson OS on my jetson nano

#Step 1 - First setup the jetson nano then update it using - sudo apt update

Now the system is updated and ready to install mediapipe

#Step 2 -  Prerequisites and Dependencies

Now we need to install the Prerequisites and Dependencies for mediapipe and Tensorflow

1. Install system packages required by TensorFlow: -
      sudo apt-get update
 
      sudo apt-get install libhdf5-serial-dev hdf5-tools libhdf5-dev zlib1g-dev zip libjpeg8-dev liblapack-dev libblas-dev gfortran
2. Install and upgrade pip3:

      sudo apt-get install python3-pip
      sudo pip3 install -U pip testresources setuptools==49.6.0
3.Install the Python package dependencies:

      sudo pip3 install -U --no-deps numpy==1.19.4 future==0.18.2 mock==3.0.5 keras_preprocessing==1.1.2 keras_applications==1.0.8 gast==0.4.0 protobuf pybind11   cython pkgconfig
      sudo env H5PY_SETUP_REQUIRES=0 pip3 install -U h5py==3.1.0

#Step 3 - Now we need to install opencv-python:

     sudo apt-get install python3-opencv 
     sudo apt-get remove python3-opencv 

#Step 4 - Increase swap for more swap ram 

https://github.com/JetsonHacksNano/installSwapfile.git

git clone https://github.com/JetsonHacksNano/installSwapfile.git  

cd installSwapfile

./installSwapfile.sh

Now all the Prerequisites and Dependencies are installed 

Now letâ€™s get the mediapipe source code: 

cd

git clone https://github.com/google/mediapipe.git

cd mediapipe

Now let's Install it from the source code:

sudo apt-get install -y libopencv-core-dev  libopencv-highgui-dev libopencv-calib3d-dev libopencv-features2d-dev libopencv-imgproc-dev libopencv-video-dev

sudo chmod 744 setup_opencv.sh

setup_opencv.sh

#Step 5 

sudo pip3 install opencv_contrib_python

git clone https://github.com/PINTO0309/mediapipe-bin

cd mediapipe-bin

./v0.8.5/numpy119x/mediapipe-0.8.5_cuda102-cp36-cp36m-linux_aarch64_numpy119x_jetsonnano_L4T32.5.1_download.sh

sudo pip3 install numpy-1.19.4-cp36-none-manylinux2014_aarch64.whl mediapipe-0.8.5_cuda102-cp36-none-linux_aarch64.whl

pip3 install dataclasses 



Now all installation is completed , lets try to run a example program to make sure that it is working properly 

Download the file from my GitHub and try running it on your computer
